# Express-React-Project2
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

You will get this error > client@0.1.0 start
> react-scripts start 'react-scripts' is not recognized as an internal or external command, on the client or frontend when npm run after you clone the repository and go to the client folder (cd client). No worries!
install the dependency of npm install react-scripts on the client folder and should work fine

1. Country Info App 🌎
   A React and NodeJS web application that allows users to search for any country and get information about it, such as capital, population, currency, languages, flag, etc. The app uses the REST Countries API to fetch the data from the backend server built with NodeJS and Express.

2. Installation and Usage 🛠️
   To run the app locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine: git clone (The git repository)
Navigate to the project folder: cd client
Install the dependencies for both the frontend and the backend: npm install
Start the backend server: npm start dev (This does not need to be done since the backend is hosted by render)
Start the frontend app: npm start
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the app in action.
